# Passwords generator

To be honest, I don't really trust sites with password generation,
but I like to set very complex passwords myself.
So here's my little open source password generator.

> You need to download Nodejs to run it

To start program:

1. First, download [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Clone this repository using the command below
3. Open the command line in downloaded folder
4. Open ./src/settings.json and —Åhange the settings to your taste
5. Run the program using the command below

To clone repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kyzinatra/passwords_generator.git
cd img_parser
```

To run the program:

```sh
npm install
npm run start
```

If everything is done correctly you will see the generated passwords in the console
